# VRAssaultCourse :trophy:
## Project Description:

This project is being developed for my final year project for Univeristy degree, Computing and Games Development. This project's current working title is called VR Assault Course, the game offers a virtually immersive experience in completing assault courses and dodging extreme obstacles, the project will have two stages of development; the first stage will focus on the mechanics and single player aspect of the game, the second stage will focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game allowing connectivity. For the first stage of development I will be focusing on the core mechanics of VR and the single player aspect of the project, for the second stage of development I will be focusing on the multiplayer aspect on the project and implementing easy functionality for connectivity. For the single player part of the project, there multiple levels with variations, you will be rewarded with badges for completing depending on competition time, if they completed the level successfully and if they completed the level challenges.

Using Photon Unity Networking (PUN) version two, a Unity package for multiplayer games. After doing research I will be enabling multiplayer access by using the free package of PUN 2 as it has all the features as the paid packages except the amount of player, I can have running. For this style of game, I will be using the PUN 2 package to create ‘rooms’ for players to play in, these rooms will have a variety of options to use and modify. I will be designing the multiplayer to allow users to have three different options of enjoying my multiplayer experience:

*	Create a private room and be provide with a server code to share
*	Have a list of open rooms available to choose from
*	Randomly be placed into an open room

As multiplayer can be a complex thing to achieve, I will be working on have a max room size of 4 with plans to increase the size depending on progress on the game and networking in the game. Stay tuned for regular commits during development of this project :)
